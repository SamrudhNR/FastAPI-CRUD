# FastAPI-CRUD

Memory updated
Hereâ€™s a GitHub README file draft for your project, incorporating the CRUD app, pipeline (work in progress), and troubleshooting context:

FastAPI CRUD Application with Pipeline Integration (WIP)
This repository contains a FastAPI-based CRUD application for managing users and orders, utilizing PostgreSQL as the database and asynchronous features for high performance. Additionally, this project aims to integrate a scalable pipeline system (under development) to demonstrate the use of advanced software engineering practices.

Features
CRUD Operations
Users: Create, Read, Update, and Delete users with attributes like name and email.
Orders: Manage product orders tied to users, including attributes like product name, quantity, and order date.

Technologies
Backend Framework: FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM (async capabilities)
Validation: Pydantic models for request/response validation
Deployment-ready: Compatible with tools like Docker and Kubernetes (pipeline integration in progress)

Project Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.11+
PostgreSQL 13+
asyncpg, sqlalchemy, and FastAPI libraries installed.


Pipeline Progress (Part 2)
Objective: Build a robust text-to-JSON processing pipeline with APIs and LLMs.
Completed-

1.Setup OpenAI API Integration:
Successfully integrated OpenAI API for processing raw text data.
Added API key configuration using environment variables.

2.Prompt Engineering:
Created basic prompts for generating structured JSON outputs.

3.Validation with Pydantic Models:
Defined Pydantic models to validate input and output data for integrity.

4.Error Handling:
Partially implemented error handling to address OpenAI API-related failures and rate limits.

5.FastAPI Endpoint:
Developed a /orders/ai endpoint in FastAPI to receive raw text inputs and return processed outputs from OpenAI.

Pending
1.Fix OpenAI API Compatibility:
OpenAI's ChatCompletion and Completion APIs were updated in openai>=1.0.0.
Address compatibility issues and ensure correct API usage.

2.Local Model Integration:
Set up and integrate a locally hosted LLM (e.g., LLaMA).
Implement the same data pipeline for processing text using the local model.

3.Comparison and Report Generation:
Compare outputs between OpenAI/Gemini API and the local model.
Generate a report highlighting differences, accuracy, and performance.

4.Comprehensive Error Handling:
Handle invalid responses and rate limits more robustly.
